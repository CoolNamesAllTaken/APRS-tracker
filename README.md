# APRS-tracker
Code written by John McNelly for an Arduino Mega, used to packetize sensor data and GPS coordinates into data packets following the protocol of the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) network, a HAM radio network used to track objects and send messages.

This code was used on an Arduino Mega in conjunction with a TinyPack Terminal Node Controller and a Baofeng BF-F8+ handheld radio, and was mounted inside a weather balloon payload to transmit live sensor data and GPS coordinates to a ground station during the balloon's flight.
